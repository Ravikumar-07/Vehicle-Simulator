 The application should be able to create, display, update, delete Scenario and Vehicle, a 
scenario can have multiple vehicles, and vehicles should be able move when user click a button 
based on the scenario and vehicles parameters.
 The scenario should have following fields:

o Vehicle id
o Vehicle name
o Initial Position X
o Initial Position Y
o Speed 
o Direction (can have only Towards, Backwards, Upwards and Downwards).
 For storing data use json-server.
 You have to create sidebar like displayed in the below images.
 Inside Home page user can be able to select the scenario whichever scenarios he has created 
and start simulation, when user click start simulation vehicles should start moving based on the 
direction and speed, till the scenario time, if the vehicles is going outside the container then 
vehicles should hide.
 While adding the Vehicle do proper validation like user should not be able to add the positions 
greater than the Home page’s graph container size.
 After Completion of this project you have to deploy the application to any platform (such as 
vercel, netlify etc) and upload code to your github account’s public repository, and write a 
proper README.MD file explaining how to install your project and how to run your application 
along with the json-server and brief explanation about the project.
